      <p style="margin-right:30px">The first best things to do in Malaysia is visiting Rose Valley Cameron Highlands.
        Pahang charm is endless. With all of its natural attractions, Pahang is always visited by many tourists,
        especially in Colmar Tropicale. However, do you know if in Pahang there is a small village which is different
        from other villages in Malaysia? All the buildings in this village is old English style, complete with the garden.
        In addition, there is also the largest rose garden in Malaysia. Although it is the largest rose garden, but not much
        people who visit this place. Mostly, they are only visiting Colmar Tropicale.</p>

      <p style="margin-left:30px">Sit comfortably and get yourself elevated 40m above ground where you can enjoy light snacks accompanied
        by a scenic view of nature. This round hot air balloon shaped attraction can fit up to 15 people at a time, so you can ask your
        friends and family to join you. We recommend going around 6.30 pm and 7.20 pm when you get to witness the stunning ?sunset view.
        To get on the Cove Aerobar, there are a few safety rules to follow, and one of them is that the guests' height must be 105cm and above.</p>

      <h3 style="margin-right:30px">3. Kwai Chai Hong, Kuala Lumpur</h3>
      <p style="margin-right:30px">Do all this and more in Kuala Lumpur’s Chinatown, a buzzy, gentrified area similar to Keong Saik in Singapore.
        Murals, like the iconic ones of Penang and Ipoh, adorn KL’s Chinatown. A back alley known as Kwai Chai Hong, sandwiched between rows of bars
         and eateries, depicts former trades – a coffee shop, a barber’s chair, an erhu player. Strategically placed benches, stools and a barber’s
         chair make for good photo spots. Kwai Chai refers to “ghost children”, a colloquialism and a nod to the area’s illicit activities of the past.
         All manner of vice flourished, from gambling to drugs to the world’s oldest profession.</p>
