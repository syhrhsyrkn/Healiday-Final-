      <h3 style="margin-right:30px">1. Mabul island, Sabah</h3>
      <p style="margin-right:30px">Mabul Island is recognised for having an incredible variety of macrolife,
             making it the ideal spot for underwater photographers to document some
             of the most endangered ecological species. Among the amazing creatures
             you will see beneath Mabul's waters are flamboyant cuttlefish, blue-ringed
             octopuses, spike-fin gobies, frogfish, and moray eels. It is a small,
             oval-shaped island with sandy beaches that is situated on the northwest
             corner of a bigger, 200-hectare reef. The reef slopes outward to a depth
             of 25 to 30 metres and is located at the edge of the continental shelf. In
             addition, Mabul is also a local island-village. Backpacker-style lodges and
             water bungalows are both options for lodging.</p>

      <p style="margin-left:30px">Rompin is a district in Pahang that is littered with natural wonders and is located
           by the sea and encircled by thick jungles. If you're willing to step off the usual route,
           consider planning an expedition here. There's plenty to see, including gushing waterfalls,
           welcoming orang asli communities, sandy beaches, fresh seafood, and Tasik Biru, a lovely
           lake with azure waters near Bukit Ibam. The Tasik Biru in Rompin, also known as the Blue Lake,
           is thought to have acquired its enigmatic colour as a result of chemical interactions between
           the rocks and soil. Come over to see its vibrant waters for yourself!</p>

      <p style="margin-right:30px">Aside from sprawling tea plantations and strawberry fields, Cameron Highlands
        is home to a few hidden beauties just waiting to be discovered. The charming Mossy Woodland, a wonderfully
        lovely forest buried in the highlands of Mount Brinchang, Cameron Highlands' second highest peak, is one
        such gem. The Mossy Forest, which is cloaked in a mystical aura and blanketed in strange mist, is located
        at an elevation of 2,032 metres above sea level. This moss-choked woodland was named sixth on Lonely Planet's
        list of the World's Most Instagrammable Forests and looks like something out of Lord of the Rings or Avatar.</p>

      <p style="margin-left:30px">The was formerly one of Kuala Selangor's best-kept secrets, a site only known
        to the people of the fishing town, named after its mirror-like reflection of the sky. The Sky Mirror is
        really a seafloor that comes above water during low tide, revealing a vast sand flat the size of a
        hundred football fields! During these brief periods of low tide, you will be treated to breathtaking vistas
        of the sky and sea. Don't forget to look down at your feet while you're there, and you'll likely see marine
        life dispersed abundantly in the sand - from small crabs to baby clams, sea grapes, sea anemones, and a variety
        of gorgeous shells.</p>
